ok this one is fun.

few days ago, the infosec community had fun with OpenIA (https://chat.openai.com/chat), lot of pep send ctf problem and such, and the results were actually quite good .

so i tried to ask for regular expression for basic vulnerability like command injection, local file include.




and OMG that was so good, plus github just implemented the ability to search code with regular expression, so here we are :)
